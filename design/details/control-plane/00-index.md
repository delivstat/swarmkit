title: Control plane + auth — design (inventory → architecture → phase designs)
description: The central control plane + auth program. A comprehensive inventory of what SwarmKit already is as a runtime platform (docs 00–10), then the full design — architecture (11), auth (12), connector/registry (13), aggregation (14), artifact registry (15), fleet UI (16), growth loop (17), hardening/rollout (18). Design complete through Phase 8; implementation pending.
status: design complete (phases 0–8); implementation pending

# Control plane + auth — design

The central control plane + auth program (originating proposal: `design/details/fleet-control-plane.md`).
**Docs 00–10** are the Phase 0 inventory — *what does SwarmKit already provide as a runtime platform?*
— so the design is built against reality, not memory. **Docs 11–18** are the phase designs
(architecture → auth → connector → aggregation → registry → UI → growth loop → hardening).
**The design is complete through Phase 8; implementation has not started.**

Each inventory doc uses the same structure: *purpose · public interface (HTTP routes / CLI /
config / env) · data produced & consumed · extension seams · key file refs · control-plane
implications*. Doc 10 is the synthesis — the per-feature map of *single-instance today →
what the fleet panel surfaces/aggregates/manages*. Docs 11–18 each state goal · components/flows ·
data model · decisions · what-the-phase-builds · open questions.

## Cross-cutting findings (read these first)

These surfaced repeatedly across subsystems and shape the architecture/auth phases:

1. **An auth seam already exists — but defaults open and is unschematized.** `auth/`
   ships `AuthProvider` (ABC) + `NoneAuthProvider`, `APIKeyAuthProvider` (bearer), `JWTAuthProvider`
   (JWKS). `serve` runs `auth_middleware` and selects a provider via `_build_auth_provider`
   reading a **`server.auth`** block — **which is NOT in the workspace JSON Schema** (undocumented,
   unvalidated). Default is `NoneAuthProvider` (wildcard scope) and the CLI default bind is
   `--host 0.0.0.0:8000`. So the auth phase is **harden + schematize + tier the existing seam**,
   not greenfield. Details in [02](02-serve-api.md) §Auth and [05](05-identity-governance-iam.md).

2. **Almost all persisted state is per-instance SQLite + local JSON.** Jobs, conversations,
   usage, audit, traces, checkpoints, run-state, memory all live under `.swarmkit/` on one box.
   Postgres is configurable for some backends but largely unimplemented (falls back to sqlite).
   Multi-instance aggregation is the central data-plane problem. Details in [04](04-persistence-state.md).

3. **Observability is OTel-native already.** A mature span/metric surface (`swarmkit.*`) exports
   via OTLP. The control plane should **aggregate via the OTel ecosystem**, not rebuild trace UI;
   its unique value is the SwarmKit-specific signals (eval results, intent drift, governance
   decisions, skill gaps, compression ROI). Details in [06](06-observability-eval.md).

4. **Separation of powers constrains what the panel may do.** Reserved-for-human scopes
   (`skills:activate`, `mcp_servers:deploy`, `topologies:modify`, `iam:modify`; `audit:modify`
   exists for no one) must stay un-grantable to the panel. Transport authn (who may call the API)
   and governance identity (whose approval counts) are **distinct layers**. Details in [05](05-identity-governance-iam.md).

5. **Topologies version (canary); skills/archetypes/workspace do not.** Canary routes give
   `(topology, version)` weighted routing + promotion. There is no central versioned registry for
   skills/archetypes, and no cross-instance artifact store. Details in [02](02-serve-api.md) §Canary, [07](07-schema.md).

6. **The UI is single-instance + zero-auth, but the API client is cleanly decoupled.**
   `lib/api.ts` is REST-over-`NEXT_PUBLIC_SWARMKIT_API`; reusable for a panel once auth headers,
   instance selection, and 401 handling are added. Composer is YAML-editing only. Details in [09](09-ui.md).

## How to use this inventory

- **Designing the control plane?** Start with [10](10-capability-map.md), then drill into the
  subsystem doc for each capability.
- **Designing auth?** [02 §Auth](02-serve-api.md) + [05](05-identity-governance-iam.md) are the
  source of truth for the existing seam and the constraints it must respect.
- **Building the connector?** [02](02-serve-api.md) is the contract; [04](04-persistence-state.md)
  is what flows over it.
