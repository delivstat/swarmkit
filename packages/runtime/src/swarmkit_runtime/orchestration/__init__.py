"""The engine-agnostic pipeline **drive contract** (design/details/orchestration-provider-seam.md).

Pipeline *sequencing* is a pluggable seam, not a bespoke saga engine SwarmKit owns. This module
holds the *only* part of that seam the runtime carries: the small, generic **drive contract** an
orchestrator calls into — "run this stage as a bounded governed run" — plus the shape of what a
stage run returns. It is deliberately **domain-neutral**: the runtime models no business instance,
it only stamps an opaque ``correlation_id`` on each run so the append-only audit assembles the
cross-stage trail regardless of what sequenced it.

What lives elsewhere, on purpose:

- The ``OrchestrationProvider`` a durable engine *implements* (start / signal / state / cancel), the
  live ``SagaView``, and any domain vocabulary (a requirement id, a contract lock) belong to the
  orchestrator — see ``examples/sdlc-pipeline/orchestrator/`` for the reference controller and the
  Temporal adapter. The runtime never imports them.

The two runtime-side seams (design "What SwarmKit exposes"):

- :data:`RunStage` — ``(correlation_id, stage) -> StageOutcome``: kick the stage's topology as a
  bounded run, stamped with the correlation id. Production wraps ``swarmkit serve``; tests/demos
  wrap the ``StageRunner`` or a scripted stub.
- the gate-resolution notification (an orchestrator *learns* a funnel gate's result; the pause
  itself is a SwarmKit checkpoint resumed by humans) — surfaced over serve, not a type here.
